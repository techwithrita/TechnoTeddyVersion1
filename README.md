# TechnoTeddyVersion1
This is the code used for my TechnoTeddy project with ESP32 Devkit V1 board and 2 TFT round displays. I have not yet added features / functionality for the microphone input, PWM for motor drivers and other features... these are to be added soon as I work on improving the functioning eye movements, much like Bodmer's animated eyes library.

I cannot use the Bodmer TFT_eSPI AnimatedEyes2 library as I originally thought because the eyes cannot scale up to the size I desire, also, I cannot manipulate the eye pupils in the way I'd like to. Thus, I've taken on the challenge of creating my own code from scratch to create eyes that are manipulated by color, sound and other input, and work efficiently with ESP32 (and really all boards). Also, this code will be from a beginner's perspective as I am no pro at coding and will therefor create an easy-to-read and understand format for all to work with easily. I hope to bring happiness and functinoality / ease-of-use to all.

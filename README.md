# TechnoTeddyVersion1
This is the code used for my TechnoTeddy project with ESP32 Devkit V1 board and 2 TFT round displays. I have not yet added features / functionality for the microphone input, PWM for motor drivers and other features... these are to be added soon as I work on improving the functioning eye movements, much like Bodmer's animated eyes library.
